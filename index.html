                    Hi! I'm Nicholas Miller, a 20-year-old UCF Coding student currently learning about
                    how HTML and CSS work together. Below is more about me and what I do in my daily life!
                </p>

            <h2>Job Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently I work as a Shift Lead at the Specialty Bakery known as Crumbl Cookies!
                    I've been at this store for nearly a year, learning about different types of dough,
                    toppings and more. My previous jobs include being a Car Detailer and a Line Cook at
                    2 previous companies.

                <p>
                    Currently my hobbies include working on cars and racing them! But when I'm doing neither
                    of those I love to play games on my Xbox Series X! But currently trying to build a computer
                    to play on both.
